### State management
#### Getx
<p> Getx is a friendly and most used state management solution for small to medium applications</p>
<p>In this project we will be using Getx and Firebase</p>

### Apk can be located at
Apk/

<p>The app uses a quite clear and straight forward file pattern</p>

```
- core
- features
- main.dart

```

<p> The core folder is responsible for route handling, models, firebase classes etc</p>
<p> The features folder is responsible for handling the state management(controllers and binding), UI, widgets etc </p>
